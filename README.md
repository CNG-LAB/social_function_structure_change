# Functional and microstructural plasticity following social and interoceptive mental training

Hello, please find here the code and some meta-analytical maps used for the study currently in biorxiv: 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.11.377895v7

All code of analyses is included.

We made gradients using brainspace.readthedocs.io 
Microstructural profiles were made with code that is currently part of micapipe.readthedocs.io, but previous versions can found at

Data availability

In line with EU data regulations (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR), we regret that data cannot be shared publicly because we did not obtain explicit participant agreement for data-sharing with third parties. Our work is based on personal data (age, sex and neuroimaging data) that could be matched to individuals. The data is therefore pseudonominized rather than anonymized and falls under the GDPR. Data are available upon request (contact via valk@cbs.mpg.de). Summary data and analysis scripts (Matlab and python) to reproduce primary analyses and figures are publicly available on GitHub, and raw data-plots are provided for network-level analyses.
